<h1>TO MY PERSON</h1>
<p>
My name is Mayank Sakkarwal, I am 20 years old and come from New Delhi. The love for photography began in 2015 when I spontaneously bought my first SLR camera.<br><br>


I found the first attempts to photograph insects and other small animals, to photograph the flowers in the garden or to capture water droplets in flight extremely exciting. <br><br>


Until one day the old, vacant BayWa site behind our house piqued my interest. I entered the huge warehouse with my camera through one of the high iron gates. Time seemed to stand still here. The sparse light that came through blind windows with missing pieces of glass here and there, the floor covered by a thick film of oil and dust, it was fascinating for me and I tried to capture this mood with my camera. <br><br>


The silence that such a place brings with it is pure tension. Life goes on in front of the gates, the noise of engines, people running around hectically but inside you often only hear the shutter release of the camera echoing through the endless corridors. <br><br>


So the search for more forgotten and abandoned places began with enthusiasm.<br><br>


My second passion continues to be nature and landscape photography. Often hours of waiting in the dark, in the cold, the wind blows around your ears until the perfect moment finally arrives and the sun appears on the horizon or the center of the Milky Way becomes visible. In order to then, often only have a very small time window of a few minutes or even seconds until everything is over again.<br><br>


I really enjoy photography and it has become a very important part of my life.<br><br>


Many greetings<br><br>

Mayank Sakkarwal</p>
